<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Ensign Babyface! What? We're not at all alike! Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. How long can two people talk about nothing? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Sorry, Data. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap&eacute;s? Are you up for promotion? I'll be sure to note that in my log. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Barring the Foo</h1>

<p>But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were just sucked into space. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talk about going nowhere fast. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? You enjoyed that. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named &quot;Enterprise.&quot; You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I am your worst nightmare! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. We have a saboteur aboard. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Shields up!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rrrrred alert! Besides, you look good in a dress. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. &nbsp;Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Sorry, Data.
